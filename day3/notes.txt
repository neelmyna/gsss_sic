range function in Python:

range(10)
Start from 0 (default start value) and end with 9 (one before 10)

range(2, 10)
Start from 1 (user given start value) and end with 9 (one before 10)

range(2, 100, 5)
Start from 2 (user given start value) and end with 99 (one before 100) with user given increment/step of +5

range(90, 10, -4)
Start from 90 (user given start value) and end with 9 (one before 10) with user given increment of -4 (or decrement of +4)

Correct way to call range, but no o/p:
range(10, 10)
range(0)
range(20, 5)

Incorrect way of callinf range: (We get exception)
range()
range(10, 20, 'abc')
range('abc')
